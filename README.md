## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract real-time weather data from the Open Meteo API, transform it into a suitable format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS. The project was initialized using the Astronomer CLI and deployed using Docker containers to run Airflow components locally. This setup helped in managing the entire workflow and ensured reliable data extraction and storage.

## Objective
### The main objective of this project was to:

- Set up an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the process of extracting real-time weather data.
- Use the Open Meteo API to gather weather data and transform it into a standardized format.
- Store the processed data in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS.
- Familiarize myself with the use of Astronomer CLI to manage and deploy Apache Airflow locally and on a cloud-based platform.
